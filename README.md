# typewrite

I loved [Keira Rathbone's typewriter art](https://www.keirarathbone.com/portfolio) when I saw it at the National Museum of Scotland.
Inspired by that, I built this — a digital typewriter with infinitely-big paper.
Of course, making art is optional — it's really just a gimmicky and inconvenient notepad!

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Credits
